## Murus Gallicus Game

This project is an implementation of the board game "Murus Gallicus" using Prolog.  
The game can be played in 3 different modes: Player vs Player, Player vs Bot, and Bot vs Bot, with the bots having 2 possible difficulty levels. The game board is size-flexible, allowing it to be enlarged or reduced within a range of values for the number of rows.
